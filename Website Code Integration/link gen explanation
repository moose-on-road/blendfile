This script does the following:
1.
Waits for the DOM to be fully loaded.
2.
Extracts the relevant part of the current page's URL (e.g., "blue-car").
3.
Constructs a GitHub URL using the extracted part.
4.
You can then use this URL as needed, for example, setting it as the href attribute of a download link.


Make sure to replace 'yourUsername', 'yourRepo', and adjust the path as necessary to correctly point to where your files are stored within your GitHub repository.

Also, ensure that the files you are linking to on GitHub are publicly accessible, and consider the GitHub's policies on raw content serving if you're linking directly to raw file content.
